# rekalogika/file

High-level file abstraction library built on top of Flysystem. It lets you work
with file objects in an object-oriented manner. A file object represents a file
in a Flysystem filesystem. It can be a local file or a file in a cloud storage,
the library lets you work with them in the same way.
